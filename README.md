## Introduction
In this paper, we introduce **RecRanker**, tailored for instruction tuning LLM to serve as the *Ranker* for top-*k* *Rec*ommendations. Specifically, we introduce importance-aware sampling, clustering-based sampling, and penalty for repetitive sampling for sampling high-quality, representative, and diverse users as training data. To enhance the prompt, we introduce a position shifting strategy to mitigate position bias and augment the prompt with auxiliary information from conventional recommendation models, thereby enriching the contextual understanding of the LLM. Subsequently, we utilize the sampled data to assemble an instruction-tuning dataset with the augmented prompt comprising three distinct ranking tasks: pointwise, pairwise, and listwise rankings. We further propose a hybrid ranking method to enhance the model performance by ensembling these ranking tasks.
